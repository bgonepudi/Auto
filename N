Hi Jared,

Great points! Debugging is a perfect example of learning through failure. It can be frustrating, but it really helps us improve.

Before coding, I usually draw the concept in a vision diagramâ€”it helps me visualize the logic and makes coding much easier.

To answer your question, I think failures that require critical thinking and persistence teach the most. When we struggle but push through, we gain a deeper understanding. Simple mistakes are easy to fix, but complex challenges force real learning.
