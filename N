Welcome! It’s great to have you here. Your experience serving on submarines for almost 20 years is truly admirable, and it’s inspiring to see your dedication to mentoring and coaching kids. Woodworking, sports, and gaming sound like great ways to stay engaged!

Looking forward to learning from you as well and having great discussions throughout the term.
