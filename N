Hello everyone!

My name is Bhavya Gonepudi, and I am excited to be here! I have over 17 years of experience in quality assurance and test automation and currently work in the tech industry with a passion for automation and process improvement.

Beyond my professional journey, I am a proud mom of two handsome boys, ages 13 and 10, who keep me on my toes! I love exploring new technologies, mentoring aspiring professionals, and balancing work and family life.

Looking forward to connecting and collaborating with all of you!
